# Curate

This application is a full stack JavaScript solo project for art appreciators who want to view, critique, and share art from the Met!

This application was a bit of a passion project of mine and a test to see if I could implement the basics of a social media platform, 'liking' and 'following,' while also incorporating my interest in art and art museums. With this web app, you can explore, favorite, and share pieces from The Metropolitan Museum of Art right from your desk! Using a multitude of technologies, such as React.js and PostgreSQL, I built this application to test my web architecture capabilites and CSS expertise, while also increasing art exposure along the way!
